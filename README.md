### Hello üê±

I am a professional in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am a Data Science instructor at Alura, where I also coordinated the construction of the Data Science undergraduate course at Alura.Tech College and created various educational materials in the field of Data Science, including postgraduate online tracks. I have a degree in Geophysics from the University of S√£o Paulo, where I also completed my master's and doctorate in Geophysics focusing on the mathematical inversion of seismic data. During my doctorate, I had the opportunity to spend a period at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Before dedicating myself to Data Science, I worked as a Geophysicist at GPR-Geoscience, applying shallow Geophysics techniques, such as seismic, electric, and electromagnetic methods. I have several scientific publications in the field of Geophysics, in addition to various courses and certificates in Data Science and Data Engineering. I am always seeking to update myself and learn new technologies and tools that can help me solve complex problems with data. I am fluent in English and interested in opportunities involving Data Scientist, Senior Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, or Geophysics. If you want to know more about me, please contact me. I would be happy to chat with you! üòä
